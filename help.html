BaseHTTPRequestHandler(socketserver.StreamRequestHandler)
<br />     |  - client_address is the client IP address in the form (host, port);
<br />     |  - command, path and version are the broken-down request line;
<br />     |  - headers is an instance of email.message.Message (or a derived class) containing the header information;
<br />     |  - rfile is a file object open for reading positioned at the start of the optional input data part;
<br />     |  - wfile is a file object open for writing.


<br />     |  The first thing to be written must be the response line.  Then
<br />     |  follow 0 or more header lines, then a blank line, and then the
<br />     |  actual data (if any).  The meaning of the header lines depends on
<br />     |  the command executed by the server; in most cases, when data is
<br />     |  returned, there should be at least one header line of the form
<br />     |
<br />     |  Content-type: <type>/<subtype>
<br />     |
<br />     |  where <type> and <subtype> should be registered MIME types,
<br />     |  e.g. "text/html" or "text/plain".
<br />     |



<br />     |  send_error(self, code, message=None, explain=None)
<br />     |      Send and log an error reply.
<br />     |
<br />     |      Arguments are
<br />     |      * code:    an HTTP error code
<br />     |                 3 digits
<br />     |      * message: a simple optional 1 line reason phrase.
<br />     |                 *( HTAB / SP / VCHAR / %x80-FF )
<br />     |                 defaults to short entry matching the response code
<br />     |      * explain: a detailed message defaults to the long entry
<br />     |                 matching the response code.
<br />     |
<br />     |      This sends an error response (so it must be called before any
<br />     |      output has been generated), logs the error, and finally sends
<br />     |      a piece of HTML explaining the error to the user.
<br />     |
<br />     |  send_header(self, keyword, value)
<br />     |      Send a MIME header to the headers buffer.
<br />     |
<br />     |  send_response(self, code, message=None)
<br />     |      Add the response header to the headers buffer and log the
<br />     |      response code.
<br />     |
<br />     |      Also send two standard headers with the server software
<br />     |      version and the current date.
